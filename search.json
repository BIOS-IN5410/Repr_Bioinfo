    "text": "Tell git about us\nWhen we use git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things. This we only need to do once.\nBelow are a few examples of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:\n\nour name and email address,\nwhat our preferred text editor is,\nand that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).\n\nOn a command line, Git commands are written as git verb options, where verb is what we actually want to do and options is additional optional information which may be needed for the verb. Type the following, replacing the text in quotation marks with your own name and email address (note that you will not see any output from these commands):\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your@email.address\"\nThis user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity.\nFor this lesson, we will also be interacting with GitHub and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when you later will be setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review GitHub’s instructions for keeping your email address private.\n\nKeeping your email private\nIf you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address for the user.email value, e.g. username@users.noreply.github.com replacing username with your GitHub one.\n\nWe will be using the basic text editor nano, so let’s git know about it:\ngit config --global core.editor \"nano -w\"\nGit (starting with version 2.28) allows configuration of the name of the branch created when you initialize any new repository. We wil use that feature to set it to main so it matches what GitHub uses:\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main\nFinally, we will set up how git behaves when it interacts with GitHub.\ngit config --global pull.rebase false\nThe commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag --global tells Git to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.\nYou can check your settings at any time:\ngit config --list\nYou can change your configuration as many times as you want: use the same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.",

    "section": "Setting up github.com",
    "text": "Setting up github.com\nWe will be using the could service for version control GitHub for sharing what we have under version control with eachother, and/or the world. For this, you will need an account on GitHub, and enable Fox to communicte with GitHub’s servers.\n\nCreate an account on GitHub\n\nIf you haven’t done so already, go to github.com and create an account.\nIf you have an account already, make sure you can log into it.\nMake sure the email address used is be the same as the one you used when setting up your git on Fox, above. If necessary, run the git config --global user.email \"your@email.address\" again.\n\n\n\nEnabling git on Fox (Educloud) to communicate with Github.com\nWe need to set up a way for Fox to authenticate with GitHub so it knows it’s us trying to connect to it.\nWe are going to set up the method that is commonly used by many different services to authenticate access on the command line. This method is called Secure Shell Protocol (SSH). SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between computers using an otherwise insecure network.\nSSH uses what is called a key pair. This is two keys that work together to validate access. One key is publicly known and called the public key, and the other key called the private key is kept private. Very descriptive names.\nYou can think of the public key as a padlock, and only you have the key (the private key) to open it. You use the public key where you want a secure method of communication, such as your GitHub account. You give this padlock, or public key, to GitHub and say “lock the communications to my account with this so that only computers that have my private key can unlock communications and send git commands as my GitHub account.”\nWhat we will do now is the minimum required to set up the SSH keys and add the public key to a GitHub account. We will only have to do it once.\nWe will run the list command to check what key pairs already exist on your computer.\nls -a ~/.ssh\nYour output is going to look a little different depending on whether or not SSH has ever been set up on the computer you are using.\nIf you have not set up SSH on Fox, the output will contain one or more of the following\n  id_fox_internal\n  id_fox_internal.pub\n  authorized_keys\n  known_hosts\nWhen you see this, continue with the next section.\nIf you have already set up SSH on Fox, the output will include the public and private key pairs:\n  id_ed25519\n  id_ed25519.pub\nThis means you can skip the next section and go directly to “Copy the public key to GitHub” below.\n\n\nCreate an SSH key pair\nTo create an SSH key pair use this command, where the -t option specifies which type of algorithm to use and -C attaches a comment to the key, in our case, your email address:\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your@email.address\"\n  Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.\n  Enter file in which to save the key (/fp/homes01/u01/ec-username/.ssh/id_ed25519):\nWe want to use the default file, so just press Enter.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nNow, it is prompting us for a passphrase. Since we are using an account on Fox that only we have access to, we can skip creating a passphrase. If you decide to do it anyways, be sure to use something memorable or save your passphrase somewhere, as there is no “reset my passphrase” option.\nEnter same passphrase again:\nAfter entering the same passphrase a second time, we receive the confirmation\n  Your identification has been saved in /fp/homes01/u01/ec-username/.ssh/id_ed25519\n  Your public key has been saved in /fp/homes01/u01/ec-username/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n  The key fingerprint is:\n  SHA256:SMSPIStNyA00KPxuYu94KpZgRAYjgt9g4BA4kFy3g1o your@email.address\n  The key's randomart image is:\n  +--[ED25519 256]--+\n  |^B== o.          |\n  |%*=.*.+          |\n  |+=.E =.+         |\n  | .=.+.o..        |\n  |....  . S        |\n  |.+ o             |\n  |+ =              |\n  |.o.o             |\n  |oo+.             |\n  +----[SHA256]-----+\nThe “identification” is actually the private key. You should never share it. The public key is appropriately named. The “key fingerprint” is a shorter version of a public key.\nNow that we have generated the SSH keys, we will find the SSH files when we check.\nls -a ~/.ssh\nThis should now include these files:\n  id_ed25519\n  id_ed25519.pub\n\n\nCopy the public key to GitHub\nNow we have a SSH key pair and we can run this command to check if GitHub can read our authentication.\nssh -T git@github.com\nIf you have never done this before, you’ll likely see this message:\n  The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.255.112)' can't be established.\n  RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.\n  This key is not known by any other names\n  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? y\n  Please type 'yes', 'no' or the fingerprint: yes\n  Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.\n  git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).\nYou may also see this message:\n  Permission denied (publickkey)\nThis is fine, we’ll fix this in the next step.\nNow Fox knows we trust github.com as a server. But we still need to give GitHub our public key.\nFirst, we need to copy the public key. Be sure to include the .pub at the end, otherwise you’re looking at the private key.\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\nThe output will look something like this:\n  ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDmRA3d51X0uu9wXek559gfn6UFNF69yZjChyBIU2qKI your@email.address\nNow, on GitHub.com do the following:\n\nClick on your profile icon in the top right corner to get the drop-down menu.\n\nClick “Settings,” then on the settings page, click “SSH and GPG keys,” on the left side “Account settings” menu.\n\nClick the “New SSH key” button on the right side.\nNow, you can add a title, for example Fox.educloud.no so we can remember where the original key pair files are located\nPaste your SSH key into the field\nClick the “Add SSH key” to complete the setup.\n\nNow that we’ve set that up, let’s check our authentication again from the command line.\nssh -T git@github.com\nYou should now see this message:\n  Hi Your Name! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\nThis output confirms that the SSH key works as intended. We are now ready to start learning version control!\n\nThis material was adapted from the Software Carpentry git lesson under their CC BY 4.0 license.",
