## Program for today

* Recap day 2
* Collaborating through git and GitHub
* Wrap up: Reproducible Bioinformatics Analysis

## Recap: a basic workflow

* Make changes to file(s)
* Inspect your changes with `git diff`
* Stage (some of) your changes with `git add`
* Commit staged changes with `git commit -m`

## Recap: Your questions

From the Exit quiz from day 2

## Hands on: `git` and Github continued

Follow the instructions on GitHub.

## Wrap up: a basic workflow

* Update your local repo with `git pull origin main`
* Make your changes and stage them with `git add`
* Commit your changes with `git commit -m`, and
* Upload the changes to GitHub with `git push origin main`


## Collaboration tips

::: {.incremental}
* Be sure that you have an updated version of the repository you are collaborating on
  * do a `git pull` before making changes
* Better to make many commits with smaller changes, rather than of one commit with massive changes
  * small commits are easier to read and review
:::

## Advanced collaboration

* **Propose** changes
  * Instead of **making** changes
* This is called "submitting a Pull request"

## What not to put under version control

* Raw data (these should not change)
* Intermediate files (usually)
* Result files that can easily be regenerated
  * Exception: if data and results are small

* Large files
  * Megabyte-sized and larger
  * Github limit: 100 MB

## Collaboration and sharing

* github.com
  * Free or paid
  * Private repositories
    * With or without collaborators
  * Public repositories

## Collaboration and sharing

* github.uio.no
  * Free for users with a UiO account
  * Private repositories
    * With or without collaborators
  * Public repositories
    * uio login required (!)

## The three "Why's" of version control

### 1. Reproducibility

::: {.incremental}
* For your future self
* For your lab-mates and collaborators
* For the person who accuses you of making up your results...

### 2. Fixability

* Why does figure 4 look different now from last week?
* "Version control makes you fearless"


## The three "Why's" of version control

### 3. Sharing and Collaboration

Makes it easy to share projects and update them, 
sometimes simultaneously, with other collaborators

Written in markdown, using git and github


## Good enough practices in scientific computing

1. Data Management
2. Software
3. Collaboration
4. Project Organization
5. Keeping Track of Changes
6. Manuscripts

## For the coming days

* Writing something in a text file: commit it to version control
