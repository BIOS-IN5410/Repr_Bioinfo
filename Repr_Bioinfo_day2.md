# Reproducible Bioinformatics Analysis day 2

For this part, you will be using Fox, not your own computer.


## Using git on Fox

The program we will use, `git`, is installed on Fox and available after you
log in.

<!-- However, we wil be using a *newer version*. 
Using (different versions of) software on Fox is done using the so-called 
`module` system.
We will be using this system throughout the course
to activiate per-installed software we need. -->

After logging in to Fox, use this command to see which versions of 
`git` is the default version:

```
$ git --version
```
<!-- 
Then, use this command to see which versions of `git` are installed:

```
$ module avail git
```

We will use version 2.36.0. To activate it, type:

```
$ module load git/2.36.0-GCCcore-11.3.0-nodocs
```

Now run `git --version` again to verify.
 -->

## Where to do the work

Start working in a folder such as `/fp/homes01/u01/ec-username/BIOS-IN5410`
replacing `ec-username` with your Educloud username.

## Getting started with git

Follow these lesson episodes:

NOTES
* If you are short on time, please skip the exercises,
these are marked with a pencil symbol at the left of the title.
* After today, **do not delete the planets folder**, you will need it again
  for the next session

* [Creating a Repository](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-create.html)
  * NOTE here you are asked to make a folder on your Desktop, but we don't have that on Fox.
  Use `/fp/homes01/u01/ec-username/BIOS-IN5410` instead
(replacing `ec-username` with your Educloud username).
